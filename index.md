## Welcome to the FAQ page of the study

### 1. Who are you?

We are technical researchers at the University of Minnesota teaming up with CaringBridge to study expressive writing. Here are personal websites of researchers, [Haiwei Ma](https://haiweima.github.io/) and [Svetlana Yarosh](https://lanayarosh.com/). 

### 2. What is the study about?

CaringBridge offers patients and caregivers compassionate ways to write and share their health journeys and get support. We want to understand if writing journal updates has any influence on journal authors' health and validate a quantitative measure of if a journal update is expressive writing. Once validated, the quantitative measure will be helpful to both research community to conduct future expressive writing research and CaringBridge to improve users' writing experience. 

### 3. Who are eligible for the study?

To qualify for the study, you must be a primary author or a co-author on a CaringBridge site for yourself or someone else, have published at least one journal update on CaringBridge in the prior seven days, and be 18 or older. 

### 4. How long will the recruitment be open?
We estimate to run the recruitment for about a month. As long as you see the recruitment banner on CaringBridge, you are able to participate.

### 5. What is required of me if I decide to participate?

The study lasts for 31 days and has three parts.
 
1. You will first complete a 10-minute pre-study survey to provide your contact, demographic, and psychophysical information (assessed by psychology instruments), after you consent to participate. 
 
2. For the next 31 days, you need to allow researchers to follow your CaringBridge site and send you survey requests via email or SMS text based on your preference. Each time you publish a journal update on CaringBridge, you will be asked to fill in a brief (1 minute) survey regarding your thoughts. 
 
3. On the 31st day, you will be asked to complete a 10-minute post-study survey regarding your psychophysical state. 

### 6. Can I leave the study if I do not want to continue?
Of course! You can leave the study at any time by contacting us via email or SMS text, or clicking the "leave the study" link in the emails or SMS texts you received.

### 7. What if I miss a survey?
Depending on the type of the survey you miss, there will be different consequences.

1. You can't miss the first, pre-study survey, because your 31-day study period begins only after you complete it.

2. It is okay to miss some brief surveys regarding your thoughts reflected in the journal updates you published during the study period. However, we encourage you to complete the brief surveys as many as possible, because they are very short (1 min each) and the quantitative measure of expressive writing relies on these inputs with more data yielding better results.

3. You can't miss the final, post-study survey. You have to fill it in to complete the study and get your compensation.

### 8. Will my information be safe and secure?
We collect your survey responses and journal updates during the study period. All that information will be anonymized and stored in secure servers of the University of Minnesota, so that only researchers of this study can access and use it.

### 9. Are there any risks to participation?

The primary risk may be difficult or challenging emotions that arise during the course of writing journal updates and answering survey questions.

### 10. What results will my participation yield?
Your valued input will result in a publication in a research conference and you can opt in to receive an email notification about study results in a lay-accessible blog post in around June, 2022.

### 11. Is there any compensation for my participation?
Yes! After completing the study, you will receive a $15 Amazon digital gift card for compensation.

### 12. What if I do not want to receive the compensation?
You can simply ignore the message you receive regarding compensation.

### 13. How can I contact you if I have questions or issues not discussed here?

You can send an email to maxxx979@umn.edu or a SMS text to 651-239-6957 to reach out to Haiwei Ma for support and help.
